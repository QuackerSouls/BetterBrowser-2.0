I’ve been working on a personal project to create a custom web browser using Python based on Chromium. The main feature I’m focusing on is allowing users to manually set their DNS servers.
Chromium is the open-source engine behind popular browsers like Chrome, Brave and Opera, and it provides a solid foundation for my project and well, it was just convenient. Python is used for the development because it’s easy to work with and well, SNAKEEE. By adding a manual DNS input feature, you can choose their own DNS server (like Cloudflare for privacy or adguard for ;) ) instead of relying on the default ones.

This feature helps users control their browsing experience—whether they want more privacy, better performance, or to bypass restrictions. While there have been some challenges along the way, like getting everything to work smoothly across different operating systems(i forgot to do that), and running out of free AI usage for day

In the future, I hope to add more features to enhance privacy and security(LOL), but for now, this browser is all about giving users a little more control over how they browse the web.
